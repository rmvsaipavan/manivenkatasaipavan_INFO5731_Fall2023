I am on no doubt whatsoever that this film will do very well in terms of awards, the whole cinema was totally immersed, the room was silent.The pacing builds as the film progresses, the second half was the best part, and I loved the ending.It gives some fascinating insight into the life and times of J. Robert Oppenheimer, most of which I knew nothing about, he's a genius, but like all of us, flawed.Cillian Murphy delivers an outstanding, award winning performance, his body language, his delivery, his sheer presence is sublime. Emily Blunt also stood out, she was terrific.I was happy to watch a second time, and no doubt, I'll gladly watch it on blu ray soon enough.9/10.\n",

Emily Blunt also stood out, she was terrific.I was happy to watch a second time, and no doubt, I'll gladly watch it on blu ray soon enough.9/10.\n",

Robert Oppenheimer, most of which I knew nothing about, he's a genius, but like all of us, flawed.Cillian Murphy delivers an outstanding, award winning performance, his body language, his delivery, his sheer presence is sublime. Emily Blunt also stood out, she was terrific.I was happy to watch a second time, and no doubt, I'll gladly watch it on blu ray soon enough.9/10.\n",

Robert Oppenheimer, most of which I knew nothing about, he's a genius, but like all of us, flawed.Cillian Murphy delivers an outstanding, award winning performance, his body language, his delivery, his sheer presence is sublime. Emily Blunt also stood out, she was terrific.I was happy to watch a second time, and no doubt, I'll gladly watch it on blu ray soon enough.9/10.\n",

Robert Oppenheimer, most of which I knew nothing about, he's a genius, but like all of us, flawed.Cillian Murphy delivers an outstanding, award winning performance, his body language, his delivery, his sheer presence is sublime. Emily Blunt also stood out, she was terrific.I was happy to watch a second time, and no doubt, I'll gladly watch it on blu ray soon enough.9/10.\n",

Robert Oppenheimer, most of which I knew nothing about, he's a genius, but like all of us, flawed.Cillian Murphy delivers an outstanding, award winning performance, his body language, his delivery, his sheer presence is sublime. Emily Blunt also stood out, she was terrific.I was happy to watch a second time, and no doubt, I'll gladly watch it on blu ray soon enough.9/10.\n",

Robert Oppenheimer, most of which I knew nothing about, he's a genius, but like all of us, flawed.Cillian Murphy delivers an outstanding, award winning performance, his body language, his delivery, his sheer presence is sublime. Emily Blunt also stood out, she was terrific.I was happy to watch a second time, and no doubt, I'll gladly watch it on blu ray soon enough.9/10.\n",

Robert Oppenheimer, most of which I knew nothing about, he's a genius, but like all of us, flawed.Cillian Murphy delivers an outstanding, award winning performance, his body language, his delivery, his sheer presence is sublime. Emily Blunt also stood out, she was terrific.I was happy to watch a second time, and no doubt, I'll gladly watch it on blu ray soon enough.9/10.\n",

Robert Oppenheimer, most of which I knew nothing about, he's a genius, but like all of us, flawed.Cillian Murphy delivers an outstanding, award winning performance, his body language, his delivery, his sheer presence is sublime. Emily Blunt also stood out, she was terrific.I was happy to watch a second time, and no doubt, I'll gladly watch it on blu ray soon enough.9/10.\n",

Robert Oppenheimer, most of which I knew nothing about, he's a genius, but like all of us, flawed.Cillian Murphy delivers an outstanding, award winning performance, his body language, his delivery, his sheer presence is sublime. Emily Blunt also stood out, she was terrific.I was happy to watch a second time, and no doubt, I'll gladly watch it on blu ray soon enough.9/10.\n",

Robert Oppenheimer, most of which I knew nothing about, he's a genius, but like all of us, flawed.Cillian Murphy delivers an outstanding, award winning performance, his body language, his delivery, his sheer presence is sublime. Emily Blunt also stood out, she was terrific.I was happy to watch a second time, and no doubt, I'll gladly watch it on blu ray soon enough.9/10.\n",

Robert Oppenheimer, most of which I knew nothing about, he's a genius, but like all of us, flawed.Cillian Murphy delivers an outstanding, award winning performance, his body language, his delivery, his sheer presence is sublime. Emily Blunt also stood out, she was terrific.I was happy to watch a second time, and no doubt, I'll gladly watch it on blu ray soon enough.9/10.\n",

Robert Oppenheimer, most of which I knew nothing about, he's a genius, but like all of us, flawed.Cillian Murphy delivers an outstanding, award winning performance, his body language, his delivery, his sheer presence is sublime. Emily Blunt also stood out, she was terrific.I was happy to watch a second time, and no doubt, I'll gladly watch it on blu ray soon enough.9/10.\n",

Robert Oppenheimer, most of which I knew nothing about, he's a genius, but like all of us, flawed.Cillian Murphy delivers an outstanding, award winning performance, his body language, his delivery, his sheer presence is sublime. Emily Blunt also stood out, she was terrific.I was happy to watch a second time, and no doubt, I'll gladly watch it on blu ray soon enough.9/10.\n",

            "   At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig G√∂ransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.\n",

The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching.

And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.\n",

The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish.

And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.\n",

However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.\n",

            "   At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig G√∂ransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.\n",

However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.\n",

            "   At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig G√∂ransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.\n",

Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.\n",

            "   At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig G√∂ransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.\n",

Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.\n",

            "   At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig G√∂ransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.\n",

Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.\n",

            "   At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig G√∂ransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.\n",

Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.\n",

            "   At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig G√∂ransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.\n",

Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.\n",

            "   At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig G√∂ransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.\n",

Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.\n",

            "   At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig G√∂ransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.\n",

Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.\n",

            "   At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig G√∂ransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.\n",

Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8.\n",

Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8.\n",

I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that .

I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8.\n",

I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8.\n",

I still give the movie an 8.\n",

Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine .

I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something \"Nolanesque\" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed.

I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8.\n",
